Union and intersection types are powerful features in TypeScript that enhance flexibility and safety in coding.
...............................................................................................................
Union Types
Union types allow a value to be one of several types. This is useful when a variable or function parameter can accept multiple types. For example, a function might accept either a string or a number. Union types ensure that developers handle each type explicitly, reducing the risk of errors.

Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple types into one. A variable with an intersection type will have all the properties and methods of the combined types. This is helpful when you want to extend one type with properties of another, creating a new, more specific type.

Why They Matter
Type Safety: Both union and intersection types help catch errors during development, ensuring data is handled correctly.

Code Clarity: They make code more readable by clearly defining what types a value can hold.

Flexibility & Control: Union types offer flexibility by allowing multiple types, while intersection types provide control by combining types into one.

Reusability: They enable the creation of reusable and adaptable components.

Refined Functionality: These types allow for precise type definitions, improving performance and reducing bugs.

In summary, union and intersection types improve code flexibility, safety, and readability, making them key tools for efficient TypeScript development.
